            <p>
              We are going to work on small projects to learn the basics of
              frontend development. We will start with HTML and CSS and then
              gradually move to JavaScript and React. We will also learn how to
              use Git and GitHub to collaborate with other developers. We will
              also learn how to use the command line to run commands and
              automate tasks. Later we will build few bigger applications and
              deploy them so that you can show them to your friends or future
              employers.

            <p>
              In a span of 4-6 months you going to learn a lot of things and you
              will be able to build your own applications. You will also be able
              to collaborate with other developers and work on real projects.
              You will also be able to find a job as a Junior frontend
              developer, if you are willing to put in the effort. You will also
              be able to continue learning and grow as a developer, and even
              switch routes later on, for example start learning backend
              development or mobile.

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
              As a seasoned Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in
              modern software development, I am passionate about building
              software with a focus on performance, scalability, and
              maintainability. With a strong focus on UI and expertise in
              Node.js backend development, I excel both in active collaboration
              with team members and working independently. I am committed to
              building amazing projects with amazing people.

            <h3>Mentoring</h3>
            <p>
              I have been mentoring enthusiasts for the past 2 years, and I have
              also helped them to find their first job as a Junior developer. I
              am passionate about helping others to learn and grow. When I was
              learning these things myself, I had a lot of questions. I had a
              lot of doubts and I was not sure if I was doing things right.
              Software Development can be a lonely and frustrating journey, but
              it doesn't have to be. We will try to make it productive and fun.
              I am always happy to help and answer questions.
